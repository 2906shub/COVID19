# Summary

```{r, out.width = "96pt", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("logo.png")
```

The objective of the [COVID19 Data Hub](https://covid19datahub.io/) project is to provide the research community with a unified data hub by collecting worldwide fine-grained case data merged with demographics, air pollution, and other exogenous variables helpful for a better understanding of COVID-19. This is achieved via the R package [COVID19](https://github.com/covid19datahub/COVID19). 

## R Package COVID19

Simple, yet effective R package to acquire tidy format datasets of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) epidemic. The data are downloaded in real-time, cleaned, and matched with exogenous variables. You also have access to vintage databases.
